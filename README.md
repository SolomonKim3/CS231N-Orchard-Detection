# CS231N Detecting Orchards in West Africa Using Convolutional Neural Networks
This was my final project for CS231N which is the Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition class at Stanford. I partnered with Professor David Lobell of the Earth Department at Stanford for this project.

Attached is our research paper:
